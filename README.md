Hey ,Guys.
A Simple instagram bot written in Python with Selenium to extract data about the food
handles on instgram .
It requires only username and password .
It will search food handles account and extract the information about their
followers,posts,likes,comments,captions etc.
I have replaced my username and password with "Sampleusername" and "Password".
